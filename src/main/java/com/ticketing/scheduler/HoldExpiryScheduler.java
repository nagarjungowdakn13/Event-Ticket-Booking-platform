/**
 * Periodically drains expired seat holds.
 *
 * <p>Runs on a fixed delay (gap measured from the end of the previous run, so ticks
 * never overlap on a single instance). Each tick loops {@link HoldReleaseService}
 * in bounded batches until a batch comes back empty, so a backlog is cleared
 * promptly without any single transaction locking too many rows.
 *
 * <p>The heavy lifting (locking + state checks) lives in the service; this class is
 * just the trigger, kept thin and free of business logic.
