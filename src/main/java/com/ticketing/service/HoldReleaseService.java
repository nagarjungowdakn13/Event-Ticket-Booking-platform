/**
 * Releases expired seat holds back to AVAILABLE and marks their bookings EXPIRED.
 *
 * <p>Split from the scheduler ({@link com.ticketing.scheduler.HoldExpiryScheduler})
 * so the {@code @Transactional} boundary is honoured (the scheduler calls across the
 * proxy) and so this logic is unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * <h3>Why it's safe</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Concurrency-safe:</b> it selects expired HELD seats with
 *       {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED}. A seat a user is actively confirming is
 *       already locked by that transaction, so the job skips it this round instead
 *       of racing — no risk of releasing a seat that's being paid for.</li>
 *   <li><b>Idempotent:</b> the query only matches still-HELD, past-expiry rows, and
 *       inside the lock we re-check the status before releasing. Running it twice
 *       (or on two instances) releases each seat at most once; a second pass finds
 *       nothing.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bounded:</b> processes at most {@code batchSize} seats per call so a
 *       backlog can't lock the whole table in one transaction; the scheduler loops
 *       until a tick comes back empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Releasing changes availability, so affected events' cached reads are evicted
 * via {@link CacheInvalidator} (after-commit).
