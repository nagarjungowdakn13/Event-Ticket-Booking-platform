/**
 * Transactional persistence + idempotency for the payment lifecycle.
 *
 * <h2>Why a separate bean from {@link BookingService}?</h2>
 * Same reason as {@link SeatReservationService}: {@code BookingService} is the
 * non-transactional orchestrator that performs the external charge OUTSIDE any DB
 * transaction. The two short transactions around that charge — <b>claim</b> (reserve
 * the idempotency slot) and <b>finalize</b> (record the result + confirm exactly
 * once) — must be real transactions, which only happens when invoked across the
 * Spring proxy from another bean.
 *
 * <h2>Exactly-once charging</h2>
 * The unique {@code (booking_id, idempotency_key)} constraint is the serialization
 * point. Two concurrent {@code /pay} calls with the same key both try to INSERT an
 * INITIATED row; exactly one wins, the other gets a
 * {@code DataIntegrityViolationException} which the orchestrator turns into a replay
 * of the winner's result. So the gateway is charged at most once per key, and the
 * booking is confirmed at most once (also guarded by
 * {@link SeatReservationService#confirm}).
